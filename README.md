A local personal homepage in form of a Makise Kurisu waifu simulator.

Following feautures are currently present:
* Makise Kurisu game sprites.
* Different greetings depending on the time of day.
* Boxes with space for your links.
* Everything is in broken Japanese, to prevent shoulder surfing and increase power level.
* She wears her lab coat only at work hours (currently hard coded).
* Security panel. Notifies you when you browse with an IP from your country. This is for users of VPNs and Tor. Also Kurisu gets worried and warns you personally.
* Responsive, with bootstrap.
* Translated to Russian(By @sudokamikaze)

The copyright of the sprites belongs to the creaters of Steins;Gate: Nitroplus, 5pb and Mages. Drawn by huke.
